# boombox.vim - Makes Vim look purty!
Adds frequently updated vim colour, theme and configuration settings to your vim install!

## Linux and Mac Installation Guide
To install Boombox on Linux and Mac, you need only run these two commands:

```
git clone https://github.com/Kleptomaniac/boombox.git ~/boombox
~/boombox/install
```

## Windows Installation Guide
Windows isn't as easy unfortunately. To install Boombox, run the following commands:

```
cd <$VIM-path> (e.g C:\Program Files\Vim)
rmdir vimfiles /s /q
git clone https://github.com/Kleptomaniac/boombox.git vimfiles
echo so $VIM/vimfiles/vimrc > _vimrc
```

After that, you're done and vim looks a whole lot prettier!
